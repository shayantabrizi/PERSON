Disclaimer:
We really appreciate bug reports and any suggestions for improving the algorithm. Please contact us via email at shayantabrizi [at] gmail [D.o.T] com.

Some codes related to the Social-Textual algorithm are based on the codes provided by Ali Khodaei to us.

The codes are dependent on retrieval-tools (https://github.com/shayantabrizi/retrieval-tools).

Usage:
	See tutorial.pdf for the instructions on how to use the codes.

Change Log:
Release 1.1:
	Improvements: The Social-Textual method is now based on a TFIDF-based method (ClassicSimilarity) instead of a language-modeling-based method. The previous implementation was probably inconsistent with the Social-Textual paper.
Release 1.0
